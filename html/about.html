      <p class="about-description">
        Owning bikes in Nepal has become a must in Nepal. Hectic traffic jams, narrow streets and 
        unreliable public transportation has made bike a basic need to everyone. Bikes are less 
        expensive than car, easy to park and can be used to transport everything and everyone. 
        These are the reasons that make bikes in Nepal a necessity.
        <br><br>
        <span class="after-1010px" id="myContent">
        Bikes mean basically motorcycles and scooters. In Nepal, Yamaha bikes are considered as one         
        of the most trusted ones. In fact Yamaha bikes are most technologically advanced and are         
        loaded with the features that make riding a pleasure.
        <br><br>
        MAW Enterprises started its operation with Yamaha since 1975 importing motorcycles in Nepal.         
        At that time, we introduced Rajdoot and Escorts bikes which are now Yamaha. Since then we         
        have been offering dozens of model to Nepalese customers. We have nation-wide network of         
        over 100 dealers. Presently, our product portfolio includes, sports models such as R15V4         
        (155cc), R15V3 (155cc), Neo-Retro Model FZ-X (149cc), Blue-Core Technology enabled models         
        such as FZS-FI V3 BS6 X-connect (149)cc, FZ-S FI (Fuel-Injected, 149 cc), FZ FI         
        (Fuel-Injected, 149 cc), SZ-RR version 2.0 (149 cc), Saluto (125 cc), Fuel efficient with         
        High Performance Scooter RayZR 125 FI (125cc), Fascino (125 cc & 113 cc), Ray Z (113 cc),         
        Ray ZR (113 cc). And these are well celebrated bikes in Nepal.
        <br><br>
        Yamaha’s motorcycles and scooters are fitted with patented ‘BLUE CORE’ engines. R15, the one         
        which introduced racing culture in Nepal has its design and engine adopted from the racing         
        beast R1. It is tremendously popular among youngsters with racing instinct. FZ, R15 in bike         
        and RayZR 125 FI, Fascino 125 FI in scooter are equipped with Fuel Injection (FI) technology         
        that not only enhances the performance of motorcycle but also lessens the fuel consumption         
        and thus increasing the mileage.
        <br><br>
        Corporate office of Yamaha Division is located in Tripureshwor, Kathmandu. Nepal’s first         
        YAMAHA Bike Station (YBS) is located at Tripureshwor, Kathmandu. YBS has a showroom, service         
        workshop, and a spares i.e. 3S outlet all under the same roof and is the largest center of         
        bikes in Nepal.
        <br><br>
        We have over 100 dealers all over nations with facility of sale, service and spare parts.
        Besides, we have more than one hundred Authorized Service Points (ASPs) in different place        
        of the country, so that customer can reach their nearest service center. We organize free         
        service camp every month in different place of the country as well.
